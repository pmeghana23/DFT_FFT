DFT_FFT
--------

The N-point DFT code is written and compared the results with numpy library inbuilt function. Magnitude plot of DFT of 3 different sinusoids is plotted at a sampling rate fixed at 128 Hz using the implemented DFT function 
The same thing is done for 8-point FFT.
The computational time for DFT and FFT is calculated  with the help of profiling and it is found that FFT takes less computational time
